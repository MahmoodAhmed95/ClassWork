# Lab: Wireframes

In pairs, pick one of the following sites and draw a basic sketch for
the site on a patch of whiteboard. Focus on capturing the key elements of layout
for the page, but **DO NOT INCLUDE ANY REAL TEXT**. When you're finished, rotate
within your squads (A->B, B->C, etc.) and see if you can identify your
teammate's site using only their sketch. Then, take a few minutes and give each
other feedback on the sketches, specifically pointing out aspects that were more
clear or less clear.

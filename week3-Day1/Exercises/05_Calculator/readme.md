# LAB 4 - Optional LAB: Calculator - (30 Mins)

### Note: Only make this work for two operands e.g. 5 \* 6

Start with the page, which has inputs and buttons for things to calculate:

- Create a new JavaScript file, link it by adding a script tag at the bottom of the body tag
- For each operation, create an event listener for the button, and whenever it is clicked:

  - Find the value of the appropriate inputs (the `.num` class might be interesting)
  - Show the result of the calculation in `#output` when `#equals` is clicked

- Bonus:
  - respond to key presses so that the user doesn't have to click the button.
  - Make it work for for more than two operands
